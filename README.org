* Rose-Hulman AI XPrize Neural Network
[[https://travis-ci.org/RHIT-XPrize/rhit-xprize-neural-network.svg?branch=master]]

This repository hosts the neural network component of Rose-Hulman's AI
XPrize robot. For more detailed information of the project as a whole,
see [[https://github.com/RHIT-XPrize/rhit-xprize-pipeline][this repo]].

** Instructions
For a quick-and-dirty startup, first =pip3 install --user -r
requirements.txt=. Then use the =build_neural_network.sh= to generate
data, split the data, and train the neural network. Usage is described
below.
** Usage
*** Generate Text Instructions
=generate_text_instructions.py <num-to-generate> <neural-infile> <neural-flips-outfile> <neural-colors-outfile> <neural-letters-outfile>=

Generates =<num-to-generate>= sample instructions and meanings to the
four .csv files =<neural-infile>=, =<neural-flips-outfile>=,
=<neural-colors-outfile>=, and
=<neural-letters-outfile>=.

- =<neural-infile>= holds the raw text (in all caps to reduce the search space)
- =<neural-flips-outfile>= holds a list of 1's and 0's signifying
  whether that instruction was to flip or not
- =<neural-colors-outfile>= holds a boolean matrix of colors:

| Red | Green | Blue | Orange | Yellow |
|-----+-------+------+--------+--------|

- =<neural-letters-outfile>= holds a similar boolean matrix of letters:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|

These each signify the desired meaning of the corresponding line of
text. Currently, each output entry will have both a color and a
letter.
*** Text-Only Trainer
=text_only_trainer.py <neural-in-file> <neural-out-file> (<model-output-file> (<model-input-file>))=

Creates and trains a new neural network using the .csv data in
=<neural-in-file>= as inputs and =<neural-out-file>= as expected
outputs. It stores the final model in HDF5 format in the
=<model-output-file>= or else =textOnly.h5=. If =<model-input-file>=
is provided, instead of creating a new neural network, it will load
the provided one and continue training it.
*** [Deprecated] Generate Instructions
=generate_instructions.py <num-games> <num-blocks> <outfile>=

Generates =<num-games>= games (lines) for a .csv file,
=<outfile>=. The games generated each have =<num-blocks>= blocks and
games only exist for one move (i.e. this doesn't produce chains of
moves building off of each other).
*** [Deprecated] Split File
=split_file.py <num-blocks> <in-file> <neural-in-file> <neural-out-file>=

Splits out the data .csv produced by =generate_instructions.py=,
=<in-file>= into two .csv files: =<neural-in-file>=, which represents
the inputs to the neural network, and =<neural-out-file>=, which
represents the output for each given input. It needs to know the
=<num-blocks>= so that it can correctly read the =<in-file>=.
*** [Deprecated] Hyperparameter Train Network
=hyperparameter_train_network.py <num-blocks> <neural-in-file> <neural-out-file> <model-h5-file>=

Creates and trains a new neural network using the csv data in
=<neural-in-file>= as inputs and =<neural-out-file>= as expected
outputs. It stores the final model in HDF5 format in the
=<model-h5-file>=. Again, it needs to know the =<num-blocks>= to
correctly read input.
*** [Deprecated] Build Neural Network
=./build_neural_network.sh <num-games> <num-blocks> <model-h5-file> (-r)=

Runs the previous three programs in succession to generate data, split
the data appropriately, and train a new neural network from that new
data. It will generate =<num-games>= games with =<num-blocks>= blocks
each, and it will store the resulting model in =<model-h5-file>=.

In an effort to save storage, pass the =-r= flag as /the last
argument/ to remove the intermediate files (=<in-file>=,
=<neural-in-file>=, and =<neural-out-file>=) as soon as possible. This
is a bad idea if you would rather keep the same data for future
training runs. If the =-r= flag is not passed, no intermediary files
will be removed.
